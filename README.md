# Full-Stack Quiz
## Description
For this week's challenge, we were asked to create a quiz that mimics a code assessment that you might be given as part of an interview process. The quiz begins when the user clicks "Start the Quiz", and a timer begins a 60 second countdown. Five different questions are presented – if the user answers correctly, they receive 1 point. If they answer incorrectly, 5 seconds are deducted from the timer. At the end of the quiz, the user is able to save their score, which is stored using local storage.

The application can be accessed here: https://eileenmh.github.io/quiz-challenge/

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
