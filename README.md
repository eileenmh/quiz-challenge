GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

- Organization
- Help with Bootstrap
- how would I do different question types, like T/F?
- For Each vs. For Loop?
- Add randomizing of question presentation and options presentation
- Using addElement vs hiding an element - use case of each?
